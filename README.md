## Rules and format for Chain Reaction:
* A predefined chain reaction (with first word disclosed) will be given to each team and team players can guess next word. 
* If team guesses it correctly, it can guess next word.
* Team will get 3 lives. If team fails to guess a word, team will loose a life.
* If all lives run out, the chain reaction stops.
* Every correctly guessed word gains 5 points. Every life lost will cost 5 points as penalty.
## Game will be conducted as below:
- We will have predefined chain reactions with 10 words each.
- We will disclose first word by default. Rest of the words will be hidden.
- If team guesses a word correctly, we will disclose that word.
- If word guess is incorrect, we will only disclose first letter of next word as a hint.
- We will continue the game till all 10 words are guessed correctly or team losses all 3 lives or time runs out.
